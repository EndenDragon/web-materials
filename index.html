                                <p class="flow-text">My name is Jeremy and I am a <strong>high school dropout</strong>. Yes, you heard me correct. I <em>am</em> a high school dropout.</p>
                                <p>Don't fret however! I don't mean this in a bad way. Seriously. I am currently in a program called University of Washington - Academy for Young Scholars (or UW Academy for short). Students in this program have dropped out of
                                high school after sophomore year and are enrolled, full-time, at the University of Washington starting around 16 years old.</p>
                                <p>Here is the screencap from MyUW. Yes, I currently major in UW Academy, no joke.</p>
                                <img id="uwacad" src="https://i.imgur.com/uDjljo1.png" title="My major is UW Acad, the most cometitive major ever existed. Its just in place so that I cannot pick a different major until I finish my high school requirements tho" alt="uwacad major">
                                
                                <p class="flow-text">I enjoy working on websites. Web development is <strong>F.U.N.</strong>!</p>
                                <p>This is certainly true. I have been working on various websites on the interwebs. Those are the ones I have been actively involved in recently:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a href="https://titanembeds.com/">Titan Embeds</a> - Ever heard of a chat application called Discord? No? Yes? Either way, it is 20% cooler than Skype. One feature that is lacking from Discord is for users to embed their chat messages on a website. You know, kinda like the IRC and how KiwiIRC lets you embed the irc into a website?
                                    Yeah, so for the past 6 or so months, I have been working on a project to allow people like you to show off their <strong>Discord server</strong> on peoples' sites. Users can send/receive messages in real-time and supports whole lotta other features in Discord (channels anyone?).</li>
                                    <li><a href="http://bronytv.net/">BronyTV</a> - A website for people who likes ponies, what a surprise! Why is this on there? No worries, this is not a mistake however! I am a <strong>HUGE</strong> fan of the television show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
                                    My role in this organization is a web developer (what a surprise), and I build cool features. Stuff like counting viewers on the stream page and pushing news updates during a stream is all made by yours truly. (Maybe you'll see me watching new pone on Saturday mornings...)</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p class="flow-text">As a web developer, I have many tools in my toolshed.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Python - Yepp! I LOVE to code the backend of a webapp using Python's Flask framework. <i class="em em-snake"></i> Very simple and intuitive!</li>
                                    <li>jQuery/JavaScript - Of course, jQuery is something that I cannot live by. Who can't resist having a library that makes writing javascript much more easier and cleaner?</li>
                                    <li>MaterializeCSS - This beautiful theme on this page (and on TitanEmbeds) was backed by materialize. It looks sleek and absolutely fabulous.</li>
                                    <li>git/Github - Who doesn't love those pretty <a href="https://github.com/TitanEmbeds/Titan/commits/master">changelogs</a>? (Also useful to rollback mistakes)</li>
                                    <li>Cloud9 - And of course, c9 allows me to code anywhere, anytime. No need to have an expensive server when I could create a workspace and run my projects in a snap?</li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <p class="flow-text">Though I am always a fan of <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>. Always. <i class="em em-horse"></i></p>
                                <p>Y'all better be ready to embrace the magic of frendship this quarter. I know I am. Who doesn't love the cute face of the Rainbow Dash? Here, <span id="spawnpone">CLICK MEH</span> for some pets. ;) Above all, <strong>Rainbow Dash is the best pone</strong>.</p>
                                <p><em>Pssst.</em> Did you know that I used to create My Little Pony <a href="https://youtube.com/TheCraftedDragon">animations</a>?</p>
                                
                                <p class="flow-text">Last but not least, some words of wisdom. <i class="em em---1"></i></p>
                                <p>CSE 154 may seem indimidating at first. So many pieces is involved in creating a website. I know, I may be some crazy random dude who does web programming. But keep in mind, I make mistakes too! <strong>Please NEVER give up</strong>, keep trying and you'll get the hang of it!</p>
                                <p>If you ever in need of some assitance with web programming, I'll be there for you. Lets make this a memorable quarter!</p>
